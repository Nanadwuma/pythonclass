#If ... Else
# Equals: a == b
# Not Equals: a != b
# Less than: a < b
# Less than or equal to: a <= b
# Greater than: a > b
# Greater than or equal to: a >= b
# These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

# An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")

# Elif
# The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".
a = 33
#a = 34
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")

# Else
# The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
 print("a is greater than b")

# And
# The and keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements:
a = 200
b = 33
c = 500
if a > b and c > a:
  print("Both conditions are True")


# Or
# The or keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements:
a = 200
b = 33
c = 500
if a > b or a > c:
  print("At least one of the conditions is True")

# Not
# The not keyword is a logical operator, and is used to reverse the result of the conditional statement:
#a = 330
a = 33
b = 200
if not a > b:
  print("a is NOT greater than b")


# Nested If
# You can have if statements inside if statements, this is called nested if statements.
x = 41

if x > 10:
  print("Above ten,")
  if x > 20:
    print("and also above 20!")
  else:
    print("but not above 20")

# The pass Statement
# if statements cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have an if statement with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.
a = 33
b = 200

if b > a:
  pass

# While Loops
# Python has two primitive loop commands:
# while loops
# for loops

# The while Loop
# With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1



# The break Statement
# With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  if i == 3:
    break
  i += 1

# The continue Statement
# With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:

i = 0
while i < 6:
  i += 1
  if i == 3:
    continue
  print(i)

# The else Statement
# With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true:

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
else:
  print("i is no longer less than 6")


#  For Loops
# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
# This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
# With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)

for x in "banana":
  print(x)

# The break Statement
# With the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items:

# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# for x in fruits:
#   print(x)
#   if x == "banana":
#     break

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    break
  print(x)

# The continue Statement
# With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration of the loop, and continue with the next:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    continue
  print(x)

# The range() Function
# To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function,
# The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.
for x in range(6):
  print(x)

# The range() function defaults to 0 as a starting value, however it is possible to specify the starting value by adding a parameter: range(2, 6), which means values from 2 to 6 (but not including 6):
for x in range(3, 6):
  print(x)

# The range() function defaults to increment the sequence by 1, however it is possible to specify the increment value by adding a third parameter: range(2, 30, 3):
for x in range(2, 30, 4):
  print(x)

# Else in For Loop
# The else keyword in a for loop specifies a block of code to be executed when the loop is finished:
for x in range(6):
  print(x)
else:
  print("Finally finished!")

# Break the loop when x is 3, and see what happens with the else block:

for x in range(6):
  if x == 3: break
  print(x)
else:
  print("Finally finished!")

# Nested Loops
# A nested loop is a loop inside a loop.
# The "inner loop" will be executed one time for each iteration of the "outer loop":

adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for x in adj:
  for y in fruits:
    print(x, y)

# The pass Statement
# for loops cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a for loop with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.
for x in [0, 1, 2]:
  pass
